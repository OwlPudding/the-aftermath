            <h3>About the game:</h3>
            <p class="desc">Our video game, the Aftermath, is a futuristic 2d platformer with a dystopian story: all fertile agricultural land on Earth is finally used up due to environmental problems such as drought and overproduction, something that can definitely happen in the near future. Because of this, all governments decide to launch a massive initiative to convert regions of the Earth into factory and  production lines to produce parts for ships to send society into space and go to the nearest habitable planet GJ 832c. What happens, however, when someone can’t afford the trip to a new planet and to provide for themselves until then? They’re left behind. This is the second problem that we address in the story: wealth distribution. Because the main character is a poor farmer, his whole way of life is destroyed when agricultural land is used up and no longer yields profit. When society leaves, they are stuck in the industrial wasteland.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="desc">The objective of the game is to lead the main character through abandoned factory environments and collect 5 main parts of a ship so that they can leave the planet and join society on GJ 832c. Along the way they have to obtain 100 portions of fuel to power the ship and avoid mutant rats that have moved into the abandoned facilities.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="desc">We chose to make a video game because we feel strongly about both environmental decay as a result of human actions and uneven distribution of wealth, and felt an interactive medium would be the best way to allow for the player to feel an attachment to these issues. The game puts each viewer of the piece directly into this dystopian future and allows them to feel a unique connection to the story by wanting to guide our character to success. It uses silhouettes to exaggerate the abandoned atmosphere of the locations on Earth and a slow, sad piece of piano music plays to show how unfortunate the situation is. Once the player obtains each of the 5 key items and 100 portions of fuel, they successfully leave the planet and head for the rest of society.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="desc">If given more time we would have loved to complete more levels (ideally 5, since we want the player to get 100 fuels portions, and there are 20 per level), and come up with an outcome for the story/refine the story slides. We have a vision that sees the main character escaping the Earth at the end of the game, however they find that, after landing on the new planet, everyone there is dead because they were unable to make efficient use of the resources and many did not survive the trip. The point of this outcome is that humans are doomed to make the same mistakes that we have made in the past and that, instead of trying to fix our current issues, we would rather abandon them.</p>
